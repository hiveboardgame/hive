In general, winning increases your rating, losing a game decreases your rating. Higher rating implies higher proficiency. Winning games vs. much lower-ranked opponents does not increase your rating materially. But winning games vs. a higher-ranked opponent can bump up your rating significantly. Winning or losing Casual games has no effect on your rating. Reminder: Rated games are only available if all three expansions are used (MLP format)."

Currently the chat does not persist in the database so whenever we deploy an update your chat messages will be lost! 2. For now, it is only possible to chat in a game (direct messages and other ways will be added in the future), spectators don't see the player chat, nor do the players see the spectator chat. 3. Sometimes the red chat notification will show new messages when there aren't any."

Double click - The default one: the first click to place / move the piece and the second click confirms the move. 3.
